			<h2>Explanation</h2>
			<h3>Figure 1</h3>
			<p>
				In figure 1, each data point represents a single day that falls in one
				of the selected months. The y-value of the data point is a reflection of
				the number of questions answered on the
				<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quiz-watch/id1454913754"
					>Quiz Watch app</a
				>
				on that particular day. The x-value of the data point is the number of
				Quiz Bowl tournaments according to the
				<a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/db/">hsquizbowl.org database</a>
				occuring on that day, and the next <em>n</em> days. The value of
				<em>n</em> is controlled by the slider. To give an example, if
				<em>n</em> is 2, the x-value for the January 1 data point will be the
				number of Quiz Bowl tournaments occuring on January 1, January 2, and
				January 3.
			</p>
			<h3>Figure 2</h3>
			<p>
				Figure 2 demonstrates how strong the correllation for on Figure 1 for
				any given value of <em>n</em>. For some selections of months, the
				y-value actually becomes negative. On the visual representation of the
				graph, these negative values are changed to 0.
			</p>
			<h2>My Intentions and the Results</h2>
			<p>
				I created these graphs with the intention of finding out if
				Quiz-Bowl-ers significantly ramp up their studying in preparation for
				tournaments, or if they keep up a study routine that goes unaffected by
				the coming and going of tournaments. By including the slider, I also
				hoped to find out how far in advance Quiz-Bowl-ers started this
				study-rush, if it happened at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I first put together the graph and examined it, I thought I had
				found that Quiz-Bowl-ers are most likely to study about 2 weeks in
				advance for tournaments. This is because when all months are selected,
				the strongest correlation occurs when <em>n</em> = 14 days; however,
				when playing around with month selections, Figure 2 fluctuates
				erratically, and any pattern you thought you might've noticed in the
				initial graph gets thrown into question. After seeing the
				inconsistencies in the data thus far, it appears that my findings for
				the research I originally intended to do are inconclusive. Perhaps the
				data will become more clear after more time, or perhaps none of this
				data is reflective of actual tendencies of Quiz-Bowl-ers and it's just
				reflective of the coincidental popularity of my app.
			</p>
			<p>
				I still believe there's value in my data and findings to be made from
				it, however. For example, in general, it seems that months with more
				Quiz Bowl tournaments tend to have more Quiz Watch usage.
